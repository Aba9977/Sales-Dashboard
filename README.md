# Sales-Dashboard
This project provides a simple analysis of a Kaggle sales dataset, including insights on top clients, sales by month, top-selling products, inactive clients, and country-based sales. It also includes basic data cleaning functions to prepare the data for analysis. This is my first data science project.
