# Sales-Dashboard
This project provides a simple analysis of a Kaggle sales dataset, including insights on top clients, sales by month, top-selling products, inactive clients, and country-based sales. It also includes basic data cleaning functions to prepare the data for analysis. This is my first data science project.


# Requirements:
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries: pandas, numpy, streamlit, jupyter notebook, seaborn, unidecode. After making sure all the required libraries are installed, you can either visualize the interface made in Streamlit, or use the Jupyter notebook if you prefer to see each function and modify its values to adjust the plots' results.


# installation:

To install all the required libraries, run the following command:
pip install pandas numpy streamlit jupyter seaborn unidecode

if you prefer to see the streamlit version:

streamlit run app.py

if you prefer to see the jupyter version:

jupyter notebook sales_dashboard.ipynb
